# MarkovBaj
Script reading comment stream from subreddit forsen, posting images to all comments with "Markov"

This script utilizes the following libraries:
Selenium Webdriver,
PRAW - The Python Reddit API Wrapper,
Pyperclip,
PyAutoGUI,
Pillow (PIL Fork)

This script uses Selenium to circumvent the Reddit API limitation of not being able to attach images to comments.
